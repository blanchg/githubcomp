h1. GITHUB contest

Current progress is disappointing but I have a few more ideas.

The biggest problem is there isn't a great deal of similarity between different users.

There is 1266 users in the test group that only have unique watches! so impossible to profile.

Most of the other users have 1 or 2 watches in common.

It appears that the average user only watches 1 or 2 repositories.
